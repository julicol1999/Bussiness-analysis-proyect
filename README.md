# COURSE PROYECT Bussiness analysis 

## Resume

This project was developed as part of my data analytics training at the TripleTen bootcamp, with the goal of applying analytical techniques in a simulated business environment. I worked with realistic data from the Y.Afisha platform, a digital ticketing service, to help optimize marketing spend through an in-depth analysis of user behavior and campaign profitability.

## Analysis Objective

The analysis focused on answering the following key business questions:

- How do users interact with the service?
- When do they start making purchases after their first visit?
- What is the value each customer brings over time? (**LTV**)
- When do the generated revenues cover the customer acquisition costs? (**ROMI**)

## Data Sources

Three datasets were used, covering the period from **January 2017 to December 2018**:

- **Visits**: server logs reflecting user sessions.  
- **Orders**: information on purchases made.  
- **Costs**: investment data by acquisition source and by month.  

## Methodology & Analysis Approach

This project applies a data-driven methodology to evaluate user behavior and marketing efficiency. The analysis includes:

- **Cohort analysis** to uncover behavioral patterns over time.
- **Customer Lifetime Value (LTV)** calculation per acquisition cohort.
- **Customer Acquisition Cost (CAC)** estimation by marketing source.
- **Return on Marketing Investment (ROMI)** computation and trend visualization.

These insights help identify which marketing channels drive the most value, and when investments start to pay off.

## Tools & Libraries

The analysis was conducted using **Python**, leveraging the following core libraries:

- **pandas** data manipulation and analysis
- **numpy** numerical operations and statistical calculations
- **matplotlib.pyplot** data visualization
